## [Unreleased]
- Added the *includeManual* argument, which applies the manually assigned indicator severity to the indicator. This overrides the DBot score. Default is "true".
- When an indicator receives a manual reputation from user, all instances of it no matter the type, will be considered as the manual reputation score given.
