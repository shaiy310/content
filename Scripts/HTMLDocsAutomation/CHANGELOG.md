## [Unreleased]
 - Added 'permissions' argument with the following options:
    - per-command - the permissions entry will be diaplayd in every command section.
    - global - the permissions entry will be diaplayd once, in it's own section.
    - none - if there are no permissions required to this integration, there will be no such entry.
 - Added a comment with html example to manually add an image, to each command html section.
 - Fixed a bug in the arguments descriptions.
