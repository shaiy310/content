Use your API token to:
1. View and manage your incidents list. The list will be updated automatically in Incidents dashboard.
2. Release email from quarantine and resend them to their recipients. Use the scan id as an argument.
If you don't have a token yet, contact PerceptionPoint support.
You can set the number of results returning by using the parameter "No. of API loops". Each loop returns 20 items top.

If you do not specify which incidents to fetch, all incidents will be fetched.
