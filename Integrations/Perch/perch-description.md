Perch Security is a crowd-sourced threat and intelligence feed which also provides network security.

To configure your integration, you must first navigate to the [integrations](https://app.perchsecurity.com/settings/integrations) menu and generate a **Key**.

The key is used in the configuration of your Perch instance within Demisto.
