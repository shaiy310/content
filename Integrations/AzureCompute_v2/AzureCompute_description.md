To allow us access to Azure Compute, an admin has to approve our app using an admin consent flow, by clicking on the following [link](https://oproxy.demisto.ninja/ms-azure-compute).
After authorizing the Demisto app, you will get an ID, Token, and Key, which should be inserted in the integration instance configuration's corresponding fields.
