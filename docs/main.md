# Demisto - Content Blog
This repo contains content provided by Demisto to automate and orchestrate your Security Operations. Here we will share our ever-growing list of playbooks, automation scripts, report templates and other useful content.

We security folks love to tinker, keep enhancing and sharpening our toolset and we decided to open up everything and make it a collaborative process for the entire security community. We want to create useful knowledge and build flexible, customizable tools, sharing them with each other as we go along.

We invite you to use the playbooks and scripts, modify them to suit your needs and see what works for you, get involved in the community discussion and of course remember to give back and contribute so that others can enjoy and learn from your hard work and build upon it to enhance it even further.

Feel free to share your story!
