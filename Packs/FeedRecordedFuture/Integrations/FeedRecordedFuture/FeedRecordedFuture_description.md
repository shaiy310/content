## Recorded Future Feed
This integration downloads from Recorded Future a list of IP Addresses, domains, urls, or file hash with known risk. 
The risk list includes risk scores and the supporting evidence details.
The feed can be configured to load a specific risk list by specifying a risk rule. 
If no risklist is specified, Recorded Futures default risklist is used. 
The feed can also be configured to load a custom risklist from a user-specified Recorded Future file path.
If no file path is specified, the default risklist file is used. 
To access this resource, you need a valid Recorded Future API token.
